.TH HSH 1 "January 2024" "Version 1.0" "HSH Manual"

.SH NAME
hsh \- Holberton Simple Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[\fIfilename\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that executes commands read from standard input or from a file.
It implements a subset of the sh shell functionality.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell first checks if the command is a built-in. If not, it searches for the command in the directories
listed in the PATH environment variable. If the command is found, the shell creates a new process to execute it.

.SS Interactive Mode
When invoked without arguments and with standard input connected to a terminal, the shell runs in interactive mode.
It displays the prompt
.B #cisfun$
and waits for user input.

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
When standard input is not connected to a terminal, or when invoked with a filename argument,
the shell reads and executes commands without displaying a prompt.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:

.TP
.B exit [\fIstatus\fR]
Exit the shell with a status of \fIstatus\fR. If \fIstatus\fR is omitted, the exit status is 0.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of the shell:

.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories to search for commands. If PATH is not set or is empty,
the shell searches only the current directory.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the following exit status values:
.TP
.B 0
Successful completion of a command.
.TP
.B 127
Command not found.
.TP
.B 1-255
Other error conditions or exit status of the last executed command.
